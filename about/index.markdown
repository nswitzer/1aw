Through college and for all of my career I've worked at the intersection of information and technology. When I realized the ability to create great websites with painless UX was completely in my hands, I seized the opportunity to build those experiences every day and left newspapers.

My experience with written and spoken communication, administrating content and building websites gives me a unique perspective and ability to plan, design, build and communicate an experience from start to finish.
