Hey! My name's Nick. I'm currently the Development Director at [Elevated Third](https://www.elevatedthird.com/). I spend my days at the office doing everything from scoping and estimating development projects to front end and theme development, with some technical project management for good measure. 

Through college and for all of my career I've worked at the intersection of information and technology. When I realized the ability to create great websites with painless UX was completely in my hands, I seized the opportunity to build those experiences every day and left newspapers.

My experience with written and spoken communication, administering content and building websites gives me a unique perspective and ability to plan, design, build and communicate an experience from start to finish.

Outside of work, I do everything I can to stay active in the Colorado mountains. In the summer, that means mountain biking, trail running and camping. In the winter, I spend as much time as possible with my feet strapped into my Burton Sherlock, but if it's a holiday weekend (gaper crowds!), I'm content to explore by way of snowshoe with my border collie Zooey.
