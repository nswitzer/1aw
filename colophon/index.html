<p>Why a colophon? A bit of a homage, really. I was a yearbook nerd in high school and worked for the CU yearbook my junior and senior years of college (one of which I was the Editor-in-Chief). On top of that, I spent a couple years working for the CU student newspaper as a reporter and, later, as the online editor (I even met my wife working for the paper!).</p>

<h2>Typography</h2>
<p>All fonts are provided by <a href="https://www.google.com/fonts" target="_blank">Google Fonts</a>. All headers, the main navigation and site title use <a href="https://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Open+Sans" target="_blank">Open Sans</a>. The main body copy uses <a href="https://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Merriweather" target="_blank">Merriweather</a>.</p>

<h2>Hardware</h2>
<p>All web development is done on my 15" Macbook Pro because a *nix system is a necessity for productive web development.</p>

<h2>Software</h2>
<p>All final HTML files are compiled by <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/" target="_blank">Jekyll</a>, a Ruby-based static site generator. Production CSS is produced with <a href="http://sass-lang.com/" target="_blank">Sass</a>, one of the best things to happen to front end web development in recent years. Local Ruby versions are managed by <a href="https://rvm.io/" target="_blank">RVM</a> because counting on your system version of Ruby is crazy. Local Ruby Gems and dependencies are managed by <a href="http://bundler.io/" target="_blank">Bundler</a> - a great way to take the guesswork out of managing Ruby Gems and Gemsets.</p>

<h2>Publisher</h2>
<p>The git repository for this site is available publicly through <a href="https://github.com/nswitzer/1aw" target="_blank">Github</a>. Compiled code is hosted with <a href="https://www.arvixe.com/" target="_blank">Arvixe</a>, arguably the best cheap shared hosting provider I've found.</p>

<h2>Content</h2>
<p>All site content is original and produced by me, Nick Switzer, unless otherwise mentioned.</p>
